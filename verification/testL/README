Observations at step 40:

   No FGMs ( J7= J8 = 0 )

   (1)  Small strain path independent from ring 13-15 outward. J = 0.63
        Ring 1:  0.679
        Ring 5:  0.670
        Ring 10: 0.652
        Ring 15: 0.637

   (2)  NLGEOM. J increases all rings.
         Ring 1:  0.243
         Ring 10: 0.303
         Ring 20: 0.456
         Ring 25: 0.533
         Ring 30: 0.593

   FGMs ( J7, J8 .ne. 0 ) but props same as above

   (3)  Small strain path independent from ring 1 outward. J = 0.67
        Same as Rign 1 value for case (1)

   (4)  NLGEOM. J is same for all rings. J = 0.24 vs 0.67 for small strains
        Path independent J-value is same st ring 1 for NLGEOM, no FGMs above.

     The J7, J8 terms for linear and NLGEOM restore strong PI !
