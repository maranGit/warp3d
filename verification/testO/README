8-node, refined mesh, 4 pt loading, 1-layer model, p-strain

O'Dowd et al. model to explore initial state concept for
J-integral in the presence of (1) user-defined
residual stresses as analysis initial conditions,
(2) mechanical loading to introduce residual stress
and plastic strain fields, followed by introduction
of a crack.

Test 1
------
      user specified residual stresses -> 
      introduce crack -> get J from crack opening 
      displacements and J using initial state

      linear elastic material properties

Test 2
------
      user specified residual stresses -> 
      introduce crack -> get J from crack opening 
      displacements and J using initial state

      nonlinear material properties (mises)

Test 3
------
      reverse bend -> unload -> introduce crack

      nonlinear material properties (mises)

Test 4
------
      reverse bend -> unload -> introduce crack

      nonlinear material properties (generalized plasticity)
