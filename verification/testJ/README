8-node, refined mesh, 3 pt loading

Observations at step 80:

   No FGMs ( J7= J8 = 0 )

   (1)  Small strain path independent from ring 13-15 outward. J = 0.42..
        Ring 1:  0.4275
        Ring 5:  0.4249
        Ring 10: 0.4191
        Ring 15: 0.4141
        Ring 30: 0.4397

   (2)  NLGEOM. J increases all rings.
         Ring 1:  0.1930
         Ring 10: 0.2324
         Ring 20: 0.3673
         Ring 25: 0.4070
         Ring 30: 0.4315

   FGMs ( J7, J8 .ne. 0 ) but props same as above

   (3)  Small strain path independent from ring 1 outward. J = 0.430
        Same as Ring 1 value for case (1)

   (4)  NLGEOM. J is same for all rings. J = 0.20 vs 0.43 for small strains
        Path independent J-value is same st ring 1 for NLGEOM, no FGMs above.

     The J7, J8 terms for linear and NLGEOM restore strong PI !
