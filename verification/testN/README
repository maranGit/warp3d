8-node, refined mesh, 3 pt loading, 3-layer model

Observations at step 35:

   No FGMs ( J7= J8 = 0 ). Domain type: "D"

   (1)  Small strain path independent from ring 2-3 outward. J = 0.45
        Ring 1:  0.4649
        Ring 5:  0.4612
        Ring 10: 0.4558
        Ring 15: 0.4478
        Ring 30: 0.4583

   (2)  NLGEOM. J increases all rings.
         Ring 1:  0.1964
         Ring 10: 0.2360
         Ring 20: 0.3745
         Ring 25: 0.4235
         Ring 30: 0.4489

   FGMs ( J7, J8 .ne. 0 ) but props same as above

   (3)  Small strain path independent from ring 1 outward. J = 0.4630
        Same as Ring 1 value for case (1)

   (4)  NLGEOM. J is same for all rings. J = 0.20 vs 0.43 for small strains
        Path independent J-value is same st ring 1 for NLGEOM, no FGMs above.

   **  The J7, J8 terms for linear and NLGEOM restore strong PI ! **


   No FGMs ( J7= J8 = 0 ). Domain type: "c" @ outside surface

   (1)  Small strain path independent from ring 2-3 outward. J = 0.185
        Ring 1:  0.1872
        Ring 5:  0.1863
        Ring 10: 0.1858
        Ring 15: 0.1837
        Ring 30: 0.1958

   (2)  NLGEOM. J increases all rings.
         Ring 1:  0.1132
         Ring 10: 0.1290
         Ring 20: 0.1757
         Ring 25: 0.1971
         Ring 30: 0.2161

   FGMs ( J7, J8 .ne. 0 ) but props same as above

   (3)  Small strain varies from 0.1868 -> 0.1978
        Same as Ring 1 value for case (1)

   (4)  NLGEOM. J is same for all rings. J = 0.12 vs. ?? for small strains
        Path independent J-value is same st ring 1 for NLGEOM, no FGMs above.

   **  The J7, J8 terms for linear and NLGEOM restore strong PI ! **
