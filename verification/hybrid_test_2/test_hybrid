c       Nasa MT, 12" wide, no bending
c
c       crack growth analysis in a M(T) specimen using
c       interface elements and cohesive constitutive model
c       the model is 1/8 symmetric (out-of-plane displacements are
c       prevented by guide plates in tests)
c
c       material is 2024-t3 aluminum, full thickness=0.09 in.
c
c       problem units are kips and inches
c
c       4 Layer MT Model -  Uniform Mesh Along the thickness
c
c       model is defined with 4 domains to run 4 way parallel
c       using mpi
c
c       the hypre solver is used w/ parallel assembly over MPI ranks
c
c       Crack plane element size = 0.01", a/W = 0.42
c
c       analysis set up to run for the first 10 of 1000 load steps.
c       the first 10 steps take 31 mins (total) cpu time for 4
c       way mpi + 4 way threaded solver execution. code uses 425 MB
c       of memory for the parallel solution.
