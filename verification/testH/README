1 layer, 8-node hex mesh, plane strain, B-bar

Standard blunt notch mesh at tip used for finite strain solutions
Initial crack front radius: 0.08 mils

=> Small strain solutions here

Crack plane is Y 0, front along X = Y  = 0, crack plane normal +Y

Units: inches

Thickness 0.075, W 1.0, S 4.0, a/W = 0.5
rollers at Y = 2, overhang beyond rollers 0.28

Imposed bending displacements on 2 set of thru thickness nodes at X = 0.5

Models:

  1. deformation plasticity, no FGMs. J7=J8 = 0

  2. deformation plasticity, w fake FGMs. J7 + J8 should = 0
     error caused by extrapolation, averaging derivatives of
     energy density and strains to get J7 and J8

  3. mises plasticity, no FGMs. J7=J8 = 0

  4. mises, w fake FGMs. J7 + J8 should = 0
     error caused by extrapolation, averaging derivatives of
     energy density and strains to get J7 and J8

Key results:

      1 and 2 are about 2.5 % different J-values on remote rings
         errors from extrapolation/averaging/derivatives

      3 and 4 are about 8.5 % different J-values on remote rings
         this is an incremental plasticity effect + errors
         in extrapolation/averaging/derivatives

      1 and 3 are about 3.9% different. caused by differences in
         deformation vs. incremental plasticity.
