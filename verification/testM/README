Observations at step 40:

   No FGMs ( J6 .ne. 0.; J7= J8 = 0 )

   (1)  Small strain path independent from ring 2 outward. J = 0.50

   (2)  NLGEOM. J increases after ring 1.
         Ring 1:  0.283
         Ring 10: 0.279
         Ring 20: 0.386
         Ring 25: 0.443
         Ring 30: 0.484

   FGMs ( J6 = 0, J7, J8 .ne. 0 ) but props same as above

   (3)  Small strain path independent from ring 2 outward. J = 0.51
        Same as Ring 1 value for case (1)

   (4)  NLGEOM. J is same for all rings. J = 0.289 vs 0.51 for small strains
        Path independent J-value is same st ring 1 for NLGEOM, no FGMs above.

     The J7, J8 terms for linear and NLGEOM restore strong PI !
