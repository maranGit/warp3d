8-node, refined mesh, thermal gradient loading

Observations at step 40:

   No FGMs ( J7= J8 = 0 )

   (1)  Small strain path independent from ring 5-6 outward. J = 0.505
        Ring 1:  0.5123
        Ring 5:  0.5095
        Ring 10: 0.5068
        Ring 15: 0.5031
        Ring 30: 0.5167

   (2)  NLGEOM. J increases all rings.
         Ring 1:  0.2298
         Ring 10: 0.2367
         Ring 20: 0.4308
         Ring 25: 0.4862
         Ring 30: 0.5155

   FGMs ( J7, J8 .ne. 0 ) but props same as above

   (3)  Small strain path independent from ring 1 outward. J = 0.512
        Same as Ring 1 value for case (1)

   (4)  NLGEOM. J is same for all rings. J = 0.235 vs. 0.512 for small strains
        Path independent J-value is same st ring 1 for NLGEOM, no FGMs above.

     The J7, J8 terms for linear and NLGEOM restore strong PI !
