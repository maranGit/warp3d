Patwarp directory
-----------------

In this directory are the source code and compile scripts (bash
for Linux and OSX, .bat for Windows) for the patwarp program.

The patwarp program converts patran neutral files into WARP3D input
files. 

On Linux with MPI execution it also uses the METIS subroutine 
library to partition a mesh for efficient parallel computation.

Files in this directory are:

README -- this file

patwarp_module.f  -- Fortran module for the patwarp source

compile_patwarp_osx -- script that compiles patwarp for OS X

compile_patwarp_linux -- script that compiles patwarp for Linux (64-bit)
                         
patwarp.f -- patwarp source for Linux platforms

compile_patwarp_windows.bat --compile script Windows W10

patwarp_windows_mac.f -- patwarp source for Windows and Mac OS X
                         platforms.
NOTE: Windows and OS X versions of patwarp do not permit
      mesh partitioning for MPI-based parallel execution,
      because metis requires a C compiler on PC.

metis-4.0 -- version 4.0 of the metis library.  METIS requires a C
             compiler, thus is not used on PC or OS X platforms.

Note:

  Building patwarp on Linux requires the Intel Fortran compiler
  (any version) version later AND the gcc compiler

  Building patwarp on Windows PCs and OS X requires the Intel
  Fortran compiler (any version).

  The script could be changed to use gfortran on all platforms.

Running patwarp
---------------

patwarp asks questions about the neutral file, output file,
and other information needed in creating the WARP3D input file.

For MPI execution on Linux, patwarp may find it necessary
to change the element numbering into a form more suitable for the
WARP3D data structures.

When this happens, patwarp has options both to print out a
table of the old to new element numbering and to create a new
Patran neutral file with the modified numbering.

Also, patwarp on Linux uses the METIS library to partition models
into domains if requested for MPI-based parallel exectution.
The METIS software is freely distributable; see details
in the metis-4.0 directory. Patwarp enables output of patran element
results files which indicate processor partitioning and blocking.
This function is not supported on Windows and OSX platforms, where
METIS is untested and requires a separate C compiler.

More information about running patwarp can be found in the Appendix to
the WARP3D User Manual.
