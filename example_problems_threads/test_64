c             upper half of a single-edge tension specimen with
c             uniform (mode I) crack-face loading.
c
c                specimen height:               4.0
c                specimen width:                1.0
c                specimen thickness:            0.1
c                crack length / specimen width: 0.4
c
c             the mesh has one element through the thickness, and uses
c             8-noded brick elements.
c
c             this problem demonstrates WARP3D's crack-face loading
c             capabilities.
c
c             the domain integral and interaction integral techniques
c             use an approximate integration scheme to account for
c             crack-face tractions. if the crack-face traction is
c             uniform, users may invoke an exact integration scheme
c             for the crack-face traction integral in the interaction
c             integral scheme. this requires a command in the domain
c             definition.
c
c             the first domain definition uses approximate methods,
c             and the second domain definition employs the exact
c             procedure.
c
c             there are 10 elements surrounding the crack tip. the
c             faces of these crack-tip elements are collapsed, but
c             maintain distinct node numbering, as opposed to
c             assigning the same node number to all nodes occupying
c             the same position in space.
c
c             plane strain conditions are applied to the model,   
c             and symmetry conditions are applied at y = 0.
c
c             a K-equivalent remote load can be applied to the model
c             by uncommenting one line.
c
c             >>>>because symmetry permits analysis of one half of
c                 the specimen, interaction integral results are only
c                 valid for mode-I. values of J calculated from
c                 stress intensity factors are also not valid.
c
c             >>>>T-stress results for crack-face loading conditions
c                 have not been verified.
