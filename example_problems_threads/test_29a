c 
c    nonlinear material, finite strain displacements, bbar.
c    model has one-layer of elements with w=0 constraints everywhere
c    to impose plane-strain conditions. the far end has 
c    rotation suppressed.
c
c    crack plane region is modeled with square elements for
c    simplicity.
c
c    loading is an imposed linear gradient over W. -100 on
c    left edge (cmod edge) and +100 on right edge.
c
c    material is simple mises plasticity with linear hardening.
c
c    temperature gradient is imposed over 20 steps.
c    plastic deformation is extensive due to restrained
c    bending deformations
c
c    subsequent variations of this problem use temperature dependent
c    material properties.
