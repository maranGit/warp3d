c
c   Fairly substantial problem for timing parallel executions.
c   About 330K equations.
c
c   20-node hex elements that model a solid bar with holes.
c   Various surface pressure loadings to twist and bend the bar.
c
c   Steel properties: 70 ksi yield, low hardening rate, regular mass,
c   large displacement formulation.
c
c   Time steps from impact to quasi-static.
c
c   Impact delta-t:  10**(-0.5)
c                    The PCG solver with HW pre-conditioner
c                    is faster than the MKL sparse direct solver.
c
c   At increasingly larger delta-t, the PCG solver convergence rate
c   slows down.
c
c   Run this problem with threads for parallel scaling studies.
